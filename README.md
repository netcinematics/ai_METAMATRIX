# ai_METAMATRIX

Combination of numerous study examples, to determine the following 4 points of Google Gemini Neural Network TRAINING using JS and TFJS. 

1. Small Model. 
2. 100 NeoLogisms "trained" 
3. TEST description or weight link. 
4. PCA visualize NN.

## METAMATRIX

Searching for a way to use this amazing data.

### OVERVIEW

The idea is to visualize concepts - in 3D dimensions - and XTRA DIMENSIONAL visualization capability. Including concept "linking", to show WEIGHT RELATIONSHIPS. A subset of topics, carefully curated into words (fine-crafted) as Neologistic, Ontology, and Taxonomy -  words that better reflect actual reality. 

### DATA

The unexpected result was a hybrid language. 

Based on innovative linguistic principles:

- Brevity

- Combinability

- Memorability

- Best Reflection of Actual Reality.

### GOALS


The GOALS here are to REVIEW AI STUDY, 

in CONTEXT of the custom data.

> can a small model reliably query a token or token definition?

> can a small model be inspected, across layers, for metadata,

> and be visualized in 3D in THREE.js scatterplot.

> to show tokens, descriptions, and relationships?

------


### PROGRESS

The SCATTER PLOT in THREE.js is complete. And takes a simple JSON object to populate. The PCA algorithm to distill the matrix... is elusive! But AI helped.
